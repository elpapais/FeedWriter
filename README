FeedWriter
==========

This package can be used to generate feeds in a number of formats, including
RSS 1.0, RSS 2.0, and Atom.

Each output format is handled by a member of the `FeedWriter\View` namespace.
These offer an interface for setting properties of feeds, creating individual
feed items, and manipulating items directly.

In addition to these basic facilities, the `Feed` class provides an interface
for mapping collections of items to a standard format for use by any of the
desired views.  Users with collection of model objects may define a single
mapping and use it to produce any view on demand.

Executable sample code is provided for all views.
